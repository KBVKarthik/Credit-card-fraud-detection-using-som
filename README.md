# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

This GitHub repository presents an innovative approach to detecting credit card fraud using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Credit card fraud is a persistent problem that costs billions of dollars each year. Traditional methods of fraud detection often struggle to keep up with evolving techniques employed by fraudsters.

The proposed solution leverages the power of Self-Organizing Maps, a type of unsupervised neural network, to identify patterns and anomalies in credit card transactions. By utilizing SOMs, the algorithm can learn the complex relationships and structures within the data without the need for explicit labels. This approach enables the system to adapt to changing fraud patterns and detect new types of fraud in real-time.

## Key Features

1. **Unsupervised Learning:** The SOM algorithm allows the model to learn from the data without requiring labeled instances of fraud, making it adaptable to emerging fraud patterns.
2. **Anomaly Detection:** By identifying outliers and anomalies in the transaction data, the model can flag potentially fraudulent activity.
3. **Real-time Monitoring:** The system can continuously analyze incoming credit card transactions, providing immediate alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
4. **Visualization:** The repository includes tools to visualize the SOM results, allowing users to gain insights into the learned representations and identify potential fraud clusters.
